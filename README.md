Learning some scala

I'm just going to be playing around with some scala stuff.

First goal is to be able to implement typical weather related functionality in scala, such as HDDs, CDDs, weather averages, interleaving forecasts, normals, and climate divisions.

To that effect, there will be several ideas that have to be expressed:

* Weather stations, which include latitude, longitude, elevation, start date, end date, etc.
* Daily Weather data, which includes information like daily max, min, and average, heating degree days, cooling degree days (possibly with different bases), precip, cloud cover, and wind.
* Hourly Weather data, which includes the temperature, and maybe other data.
* Weather aggregations, like climate divisions.
* Normals, Forecasts, and Actuals
